# Product Context: localGPT

## Why This Project Exists
The OpenAI Responses API represents a significant advancement in conversational AI, offering built-in tools, streaming capabilities, and enhanced function calling. However, developers need practical examples and starting points to understand how to leverage these capabilities effectively. This starter app bridges that gap.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Learning Curve**: Reduces time-to-understanding for developers new to Responses API
2. **Integration Complexity**: Demonstrates proper integration of multiple tool types (built-in, custom, MCP)
3. **Streaming Implementation**: Shows correct handling of server-sent events for real-time responses
4. **OAuth Patterns**: Provides working example of secure third-party service integration
5. **UI/UX Patterns**: Establishes responsive design patterns for AI chat interfaces

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **Setup**: User configures API keys and optional Google OAuth credentials
2. **Tool Configuration**: User enables/configures desired tools via UI panels
3. **Conversation**: User engages in multi-turn chat with AI assistant
4. **Tool Usage**: AI automatically invokes appropriate tools based on user requests
5. **Rich Responses**: User receives streaming responses with tool outputs, charts, file references

### Key User Scenarios
- **Research Assistant**: "Find recent news about AI and create a summary chart"
- **Personal Assistant**: "Check my calendar for tomorrow and summarize recent emails"
- **Document Analysis**: "Upload these PDFs and answer questions about their contents"
- **Code Helper**: "Generate a Python script to analyze this data and show the results"
- **Session Management**: "Switch between multiple conversation topics and resume previous discussions"
- **Conversation Organization**: "Create new conversations for different projects and delete old ones"

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Experience Principles
- **Immediate Usability**: Works out-of-the-box with minimal setup
- **Transparency**: Clear visibility into tool usage and AI reasoning
- **Responsiveness**: Fast, streaming responses that feel conversational
- **Extensibility**: Easy to customize and add new capabilities

### Interface Design Goals
- Clean, distraction-free chat interface
- Collapsible tools panel for configuration without cluttering main flow
- Mobile-responsive design for accessibility across devices
- Visual feedback for loading states, tool execution, and streaming

### Technical Experience
- Smooth streaming without lag or connection drops
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Secure credential management for sensitive integrations
- Performant file handling for document uploads

## Success Indicators
- New developers can get the app running in < 5 minutes
- Tool integrations work reliably without complex configuration
- Chat experience feels natural and responsive
- Users can easily extend functionality for their specific needs
- Code serves as clear reference implementation for production apps
